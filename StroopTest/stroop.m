%% Outline for doing experiment

%% Goal:  Find out how long it takes to detect a change in cognitive load.
% Assuming cognitive load changes instantaneously, can we detect it instantaneously?

% Options: 

% 1. Spectral features approach: great classification differentiability, but
% need 5s of data. Potentially useful for comparing activities on different
% surfaces or different prostheses.
% 2. ERP approach: instantaneous, but need multiple trials. 
% Important: Cannot find any other possible instantaneous approaches

%%

% Use ERPs to probe at different timepoints in the gait cycle; this will
% require synchronization with FSR's etc and directed stimuli.

%% 

% First find out how fast cognitive load changes. Do this by applying
% stimuli as certain times before and after the 'task' gets harder, e.g.
% when the color becomes incongruent.

% apply stimuli at certain times surrounding an easy or a difficult task:
% 1. -0.5*rt
% 2. 0 (at time that stimuli is presented)
% 3. 0.5*rt
% 4. rt
